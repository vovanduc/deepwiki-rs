# Smart Docs Skill - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 Purpose

Generate comprehensive technical documentation for any codebase automatically using Claude Code.

## ✅ One-Time Setup (Already Done!)

Skill installed at: `~/.claude/skills/smart-docs/SKILL.md`

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

### Step 2: Tell Claude Code

In Claude Code, simply say:

**Basic:**
```
Generate comprehensive documentation for this codebase
```

**Specific:**
```
Create C4 architecture documentation with diagrams
```

**Custom:**
```
Generate documentation including:
- Project overview
- Architecture diagrams
- API reference
- Deployment guide
```

### Step 3: Done!

Claude will automatically:
1. ✅ Scan project structure
2. ✅ Identify technology stack
3. ✅ Analyze architecture patterns
4. ✅ Generate markdown docs with Mermaid diagrams
5. ✅ Create `./docs/` directory with all files

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Claude doesn't recognize the skill

**Solution**: Restart Claude Code or explicitly invoke:
```
Use the smart-docs skill to generate documentation
```

### Issue: Documentation incomplete

**Solution**: For large codebases, generate in phases:
```
Phase 1: Generate overview and architecture
Phase 2: Generate workflow documentation
Phase 3: Generate deep dive for module X
```

### Issue: Wrong technology stack detected

**Solution**: Be explicit in prompt:
```
This is a Python Django project with React frontend.
Generate documentation for this stack.
```

## 📊 Quality Metrics

Expected quality for different project sizes:

| Project Size | Time | Lines of Docs | Diagrams | Quality |
|--------------|------|---------------|----------|---------|
| **Small** (<100 files) | 5-10 min | 500-1000 | 3-5 | Excellent |
| **Medium** (100-1000 files) | 15-25 min | 1500-2500 | 8-12 | Very Good |
| **Large** (1000-5000 files) | 30-45 min | 3000-5000 | 15-20 | Good |
| **Very Large** (>5000 files) | Multiple passes | Modular | Many | Good |

## 💰 Cost

**$0** - Uses your existing Claude Code subscription!

No additional costs:
- ❌ No external API calls
- ❌ No Litho binary needed
- ❌ No proxy server needed
- ✅ 100% included in subscription

---

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
Test on a small module first to understand output format.

### 2. Be Specific
Tell Claude what you need:
- "Focus on backend API"
- "Include database schema"
- "Add security considerations"

### 3. Iterate
Generate basic docs first, then refine:
```
Regenerate Architecture Overview with more details on the service layer
```

### 4. Review & Edit
Claude generates 85-90% accurate docs. Always review and edit as needed.

### 5. Version Control
Commit generated docs to git:
```bash
git add docs/
git commit -m "Add generated technical documentation"
```

## 🔄 Updating Documentation

When codebase changes:

```
Regenerate documentation based on recent code changes
```

Or update specific sections:

```
Update the Architecture Overview to reflect new microservices
```
